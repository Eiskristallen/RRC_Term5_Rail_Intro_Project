in this project I have five tables in total.
the first one is books with can has many comments and exactly one rate for each book
the second one is publisher. it contains information for a publisher. one publisher can publish many books and one book
  can be published by different publisher
  it has beed tied with books table through publish table
third one is rate which contain a rate for a book
the fourth one is publish. it is a join table between book and publisher in order to maintain the many to many relationship
  between them
the last one is comments. it's tied to books. each book can have multiple comments and one comment can only belong to 
  a single book
